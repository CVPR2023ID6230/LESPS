Pytorch implementation of our Label Evolution with Single Point Supervision (LESPS).<br><br>

## Overview

### The Mapping Degeneration Phenomenon

Figure 1. Illustrations of mapping degeneration under point supervision. CNNs always tend to segment a cluster of pixels near the targets with low confidence at the early stage, and then gradually learn to predict groundtruth point labels with high confidence.

Supervision (LESPS). During training, intermediate predictions of CNNs are used to progressively expand point labels to mask labels. Black arrows represent each round of label updates.

Figure 4. IoU and visualize results of mapping degeneration with respect to different characteristics of targets (i.e.,(a) intensity, (b) size, (c) shape, and (d) local background clutter) and point labels (i.e.,(e) numbers and (f) locations). We visualize the zoom-in target regions of input images with GT point labels (i.e., red dots in images) and corresponding CNN predictions (in the epoch reaching maximum IoU).
